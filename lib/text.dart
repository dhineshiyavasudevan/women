      ' immediately tell to their family members and police.\n\n'

      '2. Hold your bag as tightly as you can when you are taking public transport. You can use it to hit your predator.\n\n'

      '3. When you are walking on a road, keep your mobile phone handy but avoid using it. Being on'
      ' the phone makes you less alert.\n\n'

      ' the auto number with someone in your family even if its during the day.\n\n'

      'Very Important\n\n\n'

      '8. Whenever you are posting anything on social media, make sure you dont '
      'do it in real time. Because if you do, youre telling people on your social media about your '
      'whereabouts, Delay those posts by say, 20-30 minutes.\n\n'

      '9. Always ensure you arent posting anything on your social media with your address or phone number on it.\n\n'

      '10. Whenever you are giving out order for delivery at a grocery store, '
      'make sure you whisper your address or write it down somewhere and give it to the shopkeeper. Never announce it.\n\n'

      '11. Whenever you are getting your phone recharged, if it at a store, dont loudly speak up your phone number.\n\n'

      '12. Always pour your own drinks at parties and dont ever take drinks from'
      'complete strangers or even friends. If youve left your drink unattended for even a few minutes, '
      'leave it and get a fresh drink. It may have been spiked when you weren looking.\n\n'

      '13. If you feel someone is stalking you, try to find a crowded place and call someone for help.\n\n'

      '14. Self defence techniques are the first and foremost thing to which each and every woman must'
      ' be aware of and get proper self-defence training for their safety. They must be aware of some '
      'effective defence techniques such as kicks to groin, blocking punches, etc.\n\n'

      '15. Generally most of the women are gifted with sixth sense which they must use whenever'
      'they become in some problem. They should at once avoid any situation which they feel bad for them.\n\n'
      '16. Escape and run is also a good way to reduce some risks of women whenever they become'
      'in problem. They should never go with any unknown person alone at some unknown places.\n\n'
      '17. Women must understand and feel their physical'

      'weak than men and take some self defence training.\n\n'

      '18. They should be careful while communicating with someone on internet in the cyberspace.\n\n'

      '19. Pepper spray can also be proved as a useful self-defence tool however it has a drawback'
      ' that some people cannot be harmed through it even after full-face spray. It may not stop the attacker'
      ' so women should not depend on it completely and use other techniques also.\n\n'

      '20. Women should be very conscious while driving the car and going to any trip. They must lock all the'
      'doors of car while travelling with own or private car.\n\n'
